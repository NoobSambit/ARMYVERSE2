- Spotify Developer Account
- YouTube Data API v3 key

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# Database
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/armyverse?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Spotify API
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your-spotify-client-id"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your-spotify-client-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback"

# YouTube API
YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your-youtube-api-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_YT_THUMB_CDN="ytimg.com"

# Spotify Scopes
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_SCOPES="user-read-private user-read-email user-top-read user-read-recently-played playlist-read-private playlist-modify-public playlist-modify-private"

# App Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Cloudinary (for blog image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloudinary-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-cloudinary-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-cloudinary-api-secret"
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Home page redesign notes

- The landing uses a deep purple ‚Üí near-black gradient and glassmorphism cards.
- Central hero shows `public/logo-armyverse.svg` with an overlaid translucent card containing the headline and CTAs.
- Trending section displays side-by-side Top 5 for Spotify and YouTube, plus a Member Spotlight carousel.
- All play/open buttons are deep links; no cross-domain audio playback is attempted.
- Basic accessibility: semantic headings, `aria-label`s on buttons/links, focus-visible styles.

### Swapping to real APIs

- Trending pulls from `/api/trending/spotify` and `/api/trending/youtube`. Update those API handlers as needed. A fallback is used when quotas fail.
- Spotify OAuth: use the Connect button (floating on pages) or visit `/stats`. Ensure env vars and redirect URIs are set as documented above.

### Structured data (optional)

Add JSON-LD to `app/page.tsx` via a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block to describe featured playlists and blog posts if desired.

## Troubleshooting

### Spotify Export Issues

If you're experiencing issues with exporting playlists to Spotify, here are some common solutions:

#### 1. Token Validation
- Click the debug button (üêõ) next to the export button to test your Spotify token
- This will show you if your token is valid and what permissions you have

#### 2. Common Error Messages

**"Spotify token expired or invalid"**
- Solution: Reconnect your Spotify account by going to `/stats` and clicking "Connect with Spotify"

**"Insufficient permissions"**
- Solution: Ensure your Spotify account has playlist creation permissions
- The app requires these scopes: `playlist-modify-public`, `playlist-modify-private`

**"Failed to export playlist"**
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Try the debug button to validate your token
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection

#### 3. Environment Configuration

For production deployment, ensure these environment variables are set in Vercel:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your-spotify-client-id"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your-spotify-client-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="https://armyverse.vercel.app/api/spotify/callback"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_SCOPES="user-read-private user-read-email user-top-read user-read-recently-played playlist-read-private playlist-modify-public playlist-modify-private"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://armyverse.vercel.app"
```

#### 4. Spotify App Configuration

In your Spotify Developer Dashboard, ensure these redirect URIs are added:
- `https://armyverse.vercel.app/api/spotify/callback` (Production)
- `http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback` (Development)

#### 5. Debug Steps

1. **Test Token**: Use the debug button to check if your token is valid
2. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools and check for error messages
3. **Reconnect**: If issues persist, disconnect and reconnect your Spotify account
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure your Spotify account allows playlist creation

### Recent Improvements

The export functionality has been enhanced with:
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Automatic token refresh capability
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Token validation endpoint
- Improved permission checking

If you continue to experience issues, please check the browser console for detailed error messages and try the debug functionality.
